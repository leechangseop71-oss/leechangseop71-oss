👋 Changseop Lee

Junior Security Analyst | Blue Team · White Hat

🔐 Professional Summary

Entry-level Blue Team–oriented security analyst with a strong focus on
log-based threat detection, incident analysis, and system/network security fundamentals.

I approach security from an evidence-first mindset, emphasizing how attacks manifest in logs and how anomalies can be interpreted, correlated, and explained within a SOC environment.

Focus: Log Analysis, SIEM, Incident Detection & Response

Strength: Translating alerts into clear attack narratives

Working style: Documentation-driven, analytical, process-oriented

🧭 Security Focus (Blue Team / SOC)

I aim to grow as a defensive white hat hacker who understands attacks from the detection and response perspective, rather than exploitation alone.

Analyze attacker behavior via logs, system events, and network traces

Reverse-engineer common attack techniques into detection use cases

Practice SOC-aligned workflows: triage → analysis → response → reporting

“Good defenders don’t guess.
They explain incidents with evidence.”
